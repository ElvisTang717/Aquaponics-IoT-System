# Accomplishments
* Created the multimeter’s AC/DC interface on Realterm through USART, USART’s interrupts.
* Calculated input signals’ Vpp and Vrms through sampling its voltages via ADC interrupt.
* Calculated the time interval between each ADC interrupt according to the frequency of the input signal to avoid over-sampling or under-sampling.
* Calculated the frequency of the input signal based on the interval between the two consecutive rising edges of the square wave that is generated by the comparator and the edges are captured by the timer’s interrupts.
* Generated the required square wave by configuring the DAC output value as the average voltage of the input signal and setting it as the reference voltage of the comparator.
